## Leading by Example? How Elite Behaviour affects Individual Vaccination Decisions

## Abstract

Do partisans view reality through a "perceptual screen", leading them to biased conclusions about the world? Or does partisanship merely provide a heuristic about the potential implications of a policy? A sizable literature debates the extent to which citizens follow parties' uncritically when making decisions about political issues. Particularly contested is the question whether changes in reported attitudes translate into behavioral changes. I contribute to this debate by studying behavior on an issue where citizens have a strong motivation to get the facts right - vaccinations. Taking advantage of the case of a German party leader refusing to get vaccinated, I employ a difference-in-differences design to estimate the impact of this decision on partisans' vaccination behaviour. The results have important implications for our understanding of how partisanship structures citizens' understanding of politics.
